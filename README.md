#Description.
This is an online store with 5 main categories and a total of 249 products and this interface[FRONT END] help the user to search and filter categories.
Each group  of products belongs to a category.
One category only is displayed at a time.
the current/active category is Health with (id = 1)
there are 3 filters available to help filter the products.
The user can filter each category  products by using one filter or combination of 2 or more filters.

#Technical choices
I choose React library to perform this task
Axios to work with APIs
Redux to manage the state
Enzyme for testing

#Filters
You can reset and search COLOR FILTER (used input checkboxes)
You can reset PRICE FILTER (used rc-slider from react)
RATING FILTER (used font awesome stars to draw the rating component)

#Component
This project has 12 components (Product, Products, Category, CategoriesList, Filters, RatingFilter,  ColorFilter, PriceFilter, Titles, App, Color, Rating)

#Styles
For styling I used BEM(Product and category),ITCSS(to organize my code), postCSS 
and created a small grid to use.
